          Over +7 years, Iâ€™ve worked on a diverse set of projects, working from
          research to production, that include iOS, Android, web, SaaS, B2B,
          B2C, user research, data visualization, art direction and marketing

          In all projects, I seek to simplify the relationship between people
          and the interactive products they use, taking into consideration
          business goals and technological constraints. <br />
          I am self-aware of the impact our solutions have on people's lives,
          and this is the reason why I always give my best to create a seamless
          and delightful experience.
