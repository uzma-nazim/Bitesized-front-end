          I am a multidisciplinary designer with a curious mind, I enjoy to meet
          new people and understand how they are solving problems, this is one
          of the reasons why I invest my time on meetups from product management
          to everything related to design (research, design thinking, design
          system, etc.) and talking to people in general, as always can be an
          opportunity to learn something new. I see it as a chance to improve
          myself as a professional and put things in practice when I’m creating
          my solutions.

          Over +7 years, I’ve worked on a diverse set of projects, working from
          research to production, that include iOS, Android, web, SaaS, B2B,
          B2C, user research, data visualization, art direction and marketing
          design.

          In all projects, I seek to simplify the relationship between people
          and the interactive products they use, taking into consideration
          business goals and technological constraints. <br />
          I am self-aware of the impact our solutions have on people's lives,
          and this is the reason why I always give my best to create a seamless
          and delightful experience.
