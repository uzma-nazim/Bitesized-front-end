        <p className="homepagepara grey2">
          I am a multidisciplinary designer with a curious mind, I enjoy to meet
          new people and understand how they are solving problems, this is one
          of the reasons why I invest my time on meetups from product management
          to everything related to design (research, design thinking, design
          system, etc.) and talking to people in general, as always can be an
          opportunity to learn something new. I see it as a chance to improve
          myself as a professional and put things in practice when I’m creating
          my solutions.
