      I am a multidisciplinary designer with a curious mind, I enjoy to meet
      new people and understand how they are solving problems, this is one
      of the reasons why I invest my time on meetups from product management
      to everything related to design (research, design thinking, design
      system, etc.) and talking to people in general, as always can be an
      opportunity to learn something new. I see it as a chance to improve
      myself as a professional and put things in practice when Iâ€™m creating
      my solutions.
